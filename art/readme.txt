hi how are ya
-------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to say thanks for downloading!
If you don't know already, this is just a remake of Joalor64 Engine.
I started working on this because I sort of became bored one day.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Little Update Status:

I decided to finally get back to this project after finishing up another
important project. Now, the engine is coming back with new features, some
bug fixes, and a whole lot more! Maybe soon, I'll even make a version of the engine 
that runs on the latest Psych version! But for now, enjoy the pre-release!
-------------------------------------------------------------
So, yeah. That's pretty much it!
I hope you enjoy!
